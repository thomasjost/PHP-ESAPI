/**
 * The Authenticator interface defines a set of methods for generating and
 * handling account credentials and session identifiers. The goal of this
 * interface is to encourage developers to protect credentials from disclosure
 * to the maximum extent possible.
 * <P>
 * One possible implementation relies on the use of a thread local variable to
 * store the current user's identity. The application is responsible for calling
 * setCurrentUser() as soon as possible after each HTTP request is received. The
 * value of getCurrentUser() is used in several other places in this API. This
 * eliminates the need to pass a user object to methods throughout the library.
 * For example, all of the logging, access control, and exception calls need
 * access to the currently logged in user.
 * <P>
 * The goal is to minimize the responsibility of the developer for
 * authentication. In this example, the user simply calls authenticate with the
 * current request and the name of the parameters containing the username and
 * password. The implementation should verify the password if necessary, create
 * a session if necessary, and set the user as the current user.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public function doPost($request, $response) {
 *         try {
 *             User user = ESAPI::getAuthenticator()->login($request, $response);
 *             // continue with authenticated user
 *         } catch (AuthenticationException $e) {
 *             // handle failed authentication (it's already been logged)
 *         }
 * </pre>
